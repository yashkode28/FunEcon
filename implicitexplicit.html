                                This section covers what implicit and explicit costs are. Before we dive in to that, it is important to understand what Opportunity Cost is. Opportunity Cost is the cost of giving up a certain amount of resources or goods produced to obtain a different kind of good. For example, let's say the graph to the right represents the amount of pies and cakes that can be made with the resources one has. Given this information, the maximum amount of pies that can be created is 10, and the maximum amount of cakes that can be created is 30. Let's say the cakes are sold for $5 and pies are being sold for $7. What opportunity cost tells us is how much do we have to give up of one good to make the other. In this case, we can view opportunity cost as either "how much money do we have to give up from making cakes to make one pie?" or "how much money do we have to give up from making pies to make one cake?". You can tell by the slope of the graph that pies is on the x-axis and cakes is on the y-axis. The slope is -3x, so to gain an additional pie, you must give up three cakes each time. This means you are incurring a missed opportunity of 3 cakes x $5 = $15 profit from making cakes. For looking at the opportunity cost of making one cake, the ratio is reversed, you are giving up only 1/3 of a pie. So on average, you are incurring a missing opportunity of 1/3 pie x $7 = $2.33 profit. These scenarios represent opportunity cost for any situaiton.

                                Implicit and Explicit costs are the costs that all types of businesses incur. These costs are important to understand to analyze the difference between a firms' accounting profit and economic profit. The accounting profit consists of only explicit costs, whereas economic profit consists of explicit and implicit costs. Explicit costs are the direct costs of payments that occur while implicit costs are the costs that represent the opportunity costs missed that a firm could have profited on had it not gave up that resource. An example is owning a bakery. The explicit costs include Paying $2,000 monthly for ingredients, $1,500 monthly rent for the bakery, and $2,500 monthly salaries for employees. The implicit costs are the foregone salary of $3,000 per month you could earn working as a chef elsewhere, the foregone rental income of $1,000 per month if you rented out the building you own instead of using it for the bakery. Let's say as the owner, your total revenue per month is $12,000. The accounting profit in this situation is total revenue - explicit costs = $12,000 - ($2,000 + $1,500 + $2,500) = $6,000. The economic profit in this situaiton is total revenue - (explicit + implicit costs) = $12,000 - ($2,000 + $1,500 + $2,500 + $3,000 + $1,000) = $2,000. Even though you are making the accounting profit, which is $6,000 per month, the economic profit of $2,000, which is $4,000 less than the accounting profit, shows the amount of money you could be earning per month if you are worked as a chef and rented out the building instead.
