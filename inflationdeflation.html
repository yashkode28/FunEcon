                                Inflation and deflation are one of the main economic factors that impact real wealth. Inflation occurs when the general price level of goods and services rises, eroding the purchasing power of money. This means that each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services over time, diminishing the real value of savings and income. Deflation, on the other hand, is the decline in the general price level, which can increase the real value of money as purchasing power rises. While this might seem beneficial, deflation can lead to decreased consumer spending and investment, potentially resulting in economic stagnation or recession. Both inflation and deflation pose challenges to maintaining real wealth, which is the true value of assets adjusted for changes in the price level. Effective management of these economic conditions is crucial for preserving and enhancing real wealth, requiring strategic fiscal and monetary policies to maintain a stable economic environment.

                            Real wealth is determined by how much one's income has increased relative to how much inflation has increased. Real wealth is calculated as the nominal salary increase minus the inflation rate. To the right is a real wealth calculator. The calculator takes in nominal salary increase and inflation rates as percentages, where the percentages represent the increase in those factors. When looking at this conceptually, if the percentage from nominal salary increase taking inflation into account is positive, that would represent an overall wealth increase, meaning your wealth has increased relative to your previous wealth. If the percentage is negative, this means your wealth has decreased relative to your previous wealth.
