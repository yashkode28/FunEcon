                                Perfect competition is a theoretical market structure where there are numerous small firms and buyers, ensuring that no single entity can influence market prices or have complete control over an industry. The products offered by these firms are homogeneous, meaning they are identical and interchangeable, leading consumers to make purchasing decisions based solely on price. In this type of market, there are no barriers to entry or exit, allowing firms to freely enter or leave the market based on profitability. Consumers and producers have all relavant information on goods and services in this market as these kinds of businesses are popular and exist in various locations. Most firms do not try to influence or fluctuate the price of any goods or service in any way, shape or form, as they usually accept the market price as a given by industry standards, and market prices do not change very often and are often stagnant.

                            An example of perfect competition is the agricultural industry for wheat. In this industry, there are many firms that we may not necessarily know of that are operating and partaking in producing wheat by producing wheat crops. Wheat is considered as a homogeneous good, meaning that wheat produced by one farmer has the same value as wheat produced by another farmer in consumers' eyes. This causes consumers to try their best to find the cheapest prices for wheat, although for the most part, price ranges will be very similar for most firms producing wheat. Additionally, farmers have free entry into this industry as they can sell wheat to local consumers, as wheat is and will always be a high in demand product.
