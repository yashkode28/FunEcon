                                Fiscal policy is where the government fluctuates spending and taxation to influence a country's economic conditions. While it may seem that this kinds of policy only impacts people in a specific country, other countries that have strong relations and associate with the former everyday can also be impacted by it. After all, a country's government policy can have an effect across multiple countries in the macroeconomy. Through adjustments in government expenditures and tax rates, fiscal policy can either stimulate an economy during a recession or cool it down during periods of excessive growth. Expansionary fiscal policy is a policy to boost the economy, which involves an increase in public spending and tax cuts as well as aggregate demand, with the goal to reduce unemployment and stimulate economic activity. Contractionary fiscal policy, on the other hand, is characterized by reduced spending and higher taxes and is used to curb inflation and stabilize the economy. The effectiveness of fiscal policy depends on the timing, magnitude, and structure of the interventions. Policymakers must carefully consider these factors to ensure that fiscal measures achieve the desired outcomes without causing long-term adverse effects, such as escalating public debt or inflationary pressures.

                            Monetary policy involves the government monotoring a nation's money supply and interest rates by its central bank to control inflation, manage employment levels, and stabilize currency. By adjusting interest rates and influencing the availability of credit, central banks aim to maintain economic stability and growth. Lowering interest rates typically encourages borrowing and investment, stimulating economic activity and job creation. Raising interest rate, on the other hand, can help cool down an overheated economy and control inflation. The image to the right depicts a diagram of what monetary policy looks like when stimulating economic growth. The government has to lower interest rates in order for buying stocks and bonds to appear more attractive to consumers. When governments buy securities, this means they are taking out loans or buying a supply of money for themselves to invest in resources for their country, which is essential for further expanding the economy. Oftentimes, these policies that governments make is a part of expansionary monetary policy. A required reserve ratio (RRR) is essential in monetary policy as it is the minimum ratio of which the federal reserve must keep a consumer's deposit in their bank. The RRR should increase during expansionary monetary policy as this ensures that there is enough money supply incase people need to make withdrawals and helps control the money supply while maintaining financial stability.
