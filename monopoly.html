                                A monopoly is the most powerful type of competition to exist in all markets. In a monopoly, one business has complete control over all the resources and factors of production in making and producing goods and services. When a monopoly forms, this eliminates all competition from all other businesses that want to compete and do business in that industry.

                                You may have heard of the board game Monopoly. The purpose of the game is to gain as much money as possibly from real estate properties compared to the other players (your competition). If the other players go into bankruptcy and lose all their money, you have successfully made a monopoly. Monopolies are very rare in the world and are harder to form and have control over as countries are developing economically and are gaining resources, and the rise of technology also makes it harder to form a monopoly for a good or service, especially since almost all new businesses and startups rely heavily on tech, which is accessible to everyone.

                            An example of a monopoly is the oil industry. Tracking back to the 19th century, the oil industry was lead by John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Company, which controlled over 90% of the United States' oil refineries and pipelines. Because of this large percentage control Rockefeller's company had in this industry, this allowed freedom for Rockefeller to dictate prices and suppress competition, effectively stifling any potential rivals or competitors that wanted a chance to compete. This is an example of a successful monopoly as oil is used across various sectors, such as fuel for vehicles, heating for architecture, chemicals, and many industrial products. By having control over this product, Rockefeller was able to exponentiate his wealth and become one of the wealthiest individuals in American history, as his wealth was roughly $900 million. Adjusted for inflation, that is roughly $39 billion today.
