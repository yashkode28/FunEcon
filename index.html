                        Economics is the social science that studies how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies choose to allocate scarce resources to satisfy their unlimited wants and needs. It examines the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, aiming to understand how economic agents make decisions, how markets function, and how economic policies can impact these processes. Economics is studied in branches known as Microeconomics and Macroeconomics. Microeconomics studies how individuals such as households, firms, and consumers make decisions regarding resource allocation, the factors that influence supply and demand, price formation, profit maximization, and how markets reach equilibrium. Macroeconomics studies the economy as a whole, or bigger parts of the economy such as governments and countries. It explores factors that affect GDP, unemployment rates, inflation, and economic growth, as well as how fiscal and monetary policy affect the overall economic performance and stability of a country.

                            You might be wondering "why is it important to learn about economics?". Every decision made by people in society has an impact on their lives, whether it is small or large. Imagine running a local bagel store and there is an increase in demand for Everything bagels. Do you increase the price of the Everything bagels because people will still buy those bagels, potentially increasing profit? Or will a significant amount of people choose not to buy the Everything bagel, essentially causing a business loss? Imagine the government of a country decreases the money supply during an expansionary period. Does this help with international trade as our currency is worth more relative to other countries? Or does this hurt workers who are earning a lesser income now? By how much should the government decrease the money supply? Whether it is at a micro or macro level, understanding these decisions will help you be a more informed individual and will allow you to assess whether certain decisions benefit or hurt people in society.

                            Economics always uses math as a medium to describe the choices individuals, businesses, governments and countries make. Quantifying these choices helps analyze and access the impact of decisions made, which is important for future decisions for individuals and companies to make. Algebra, Calculus, and Statistics are the main types of math used when learning about economics.
