                            Supply and Demand are the fundamental concepts when looking at any free market in any economy. Supply measures how many resources of goods and services firms and individuals are willing to sell, and demand measures the wants of goods and services by consumers. In a free market, these factors always shift to equilibrium. Equilibrium is when supply equals demand. Assuming no external factors affect the market, supply and demand will always shift to equilibrium to ensure as many people as possible are satisfied in the market. Think of when many people are in a store and there are multiples lines for checkout. As people disperse to different lines, others will notice which lines are longer and which lines are shorter, and will then choose to go to certain lines. Over a period of time, the lines are equally long for the most part. Similarly, that is how supply and demand shift in a market. As consumers preferences change, prices of goods and services will also change.

                            The picture above shows an example of a supply and demand equation. The supply equation is highlighted in blue, and the demand equation is highlighted in red. The x-axis represents quantity and the y-axis represents price. For supply, firms will supply more units when the price is higher, dictating a positive relationship between price and supply. For demand, the lower the price is, people will be willing to by more units. This represents a negative relationship between supply and demand. The equilibrium point is where the supply and demand equation are equal to each other, or on the graph, can be seen by the intersection of the two equations. To the right is a calculator that represents the equations of the graph above. When inputed a price, it'll tell you what the supply and demand is.
