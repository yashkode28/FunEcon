                                An oligopoly is a market structure characterized by a small number of firms that dominate the market, where there is limited competition and little room for businesses to join and be competitive in the market. Unlike in a monopoly, where a single company controls the entire market, an oligopoly consists of a few companies that are highly interdependent; each actions by different firms can significantly impact the others. This interdependence often leads to strategic behavior, such as price fixing, collusion, and the formation of cartels to maximize profits. Industries in technology, transportation, insurance, and retail services frequently exhibit oligopolistic characteristics. The barriers to entry in an oligopoly market are typically high, which often prevents new firms from easily entering this market. Oligopolies lead to less consumer choice while keeping steady high prices, as their are usually similar levels of competition between different firms within this market.

                            An example of an oligopoly are the firms that produce and sell goods in the cell phone industry. Today, the cell phone industry is dominated mainly by Apple iPhone, Samsung Galaxy, LG, and Google Pixel. This is a marekt that would be considered an oligopoly as there are very few competitors in this market and most people buy phones from these firms. For entry into this market, there are high barriers, as making a new phone requires lots of effort and differentiating a phone in a world where our phones provides us all kinds of information and new features is difficult. Additionally, because there are very few competitors in this market, firms will closely monitor each other's actions, such as pricing, product releases, and technological advancements. Decisions made by one company can significantly impact the others, leading to strategic behaviors like competitive pricing and feature innovation. When a few or even one firm makes a certain decision, it can also affect the consumer's way of thinking when buying a phone. If phones are set at way too high prices, they might not appeal to consumers relative to other phones. However, if a phone has special features or advancements that make using the phone easier, such as FaceTime for iPhones, then a phone will appear as a more desireable choice.
