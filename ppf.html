                        The Productions Possibility Frontier (PPF) is a graph that illustrates how an economy can utilize and maximize its resources into producing two or more goods. Most PPF's illustrate two goods for simplicity, so we'll look at one that illustrates the resources between two goods. An economy can usually produce a maximum of one good or the other if it allocates all its resources into that one good. However, due to limited resources, an economy cannot produce the maximum amount of more than one good. A PPF shows how much a country can produce of one good X if it allocates a certain amount of resources into producing good Y. In the graph shown to the right, the PPF shows how many cars and boats can be produced along the equation of the line. An economy can produce any amounts of two goods that are within the area below the PPF equation or on the PPF line. For instance, this economy can produce 20 cars and 40 boats, as it is inside the area. However, this is not the most efficient use of this economy's resources, as there can still be more cars and boats produced. If we look at 30 cars and 40 boats, this is an example of an economy allocating all the resources possible into producing as many of both goods as possible, as 30 cars and 40 boats are on the PPF line, and thus the economy cannot produce any more of each good.

                            To the right is a calculator that allows you to enter any combination of cars and boats for the economy to produce. Note that the numbers cannot be too high as this economy, like all others, has limited resources. If the two numbers produce a point that is below the PPF equation, this means that the economy can produce this combination but is not allocating its resources to the fullest. If the two numbers produce a point that is on the PPF equation, the economy can produce at this point and is using all its resources efficiently. If the two numbers produce a point above the PPF line, the economy does not have resoucres to produce this combination of cars and boats.
