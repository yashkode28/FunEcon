                        Price elasticity is a concept in economics that analyzes the change in demand of a product depending on how much the price of a product changes. This is important for firms to know to ensure they make profit and not lose out on revenue while adjusting prices. The relationship between the demand of a good and its price is considered to be elastic in two cases: One, if the price of a good decreases a little bit and the demand of that good instantly goes up, increasing revenue. Two, the opposite scenario, if the price of a good increases by a little bit and the demand of that good instantly goes down, decreasing revenue. On the contrary, the relationship between the demand of a good and its price is considered to be inelastic in two cases: One, the price of the good decreases by a lot but there is not much of an increase in demand, thus causing a small increase in revenue. Two, the price of the good increases by a lot but there is not much loss of demand for that good, meaning many people still desire that good, and the overall revenue decreases by a small amount.

                            To the right is a calculator for price elasticity. The equation for price elasticity is the different of the initial and final quantities for the good divided by the average of the two quantities of that good, divded by the difference in initial and final price of the good, divided by the average of the two prices. If the price elasticity comes out to be grater than one, the relationship between price and demand is said to be elastic. If the price elasticity comes out to be less than one, the relationship between price and demand is said to be inelastic. Lastly, if it is exactly one, it is considered neither elastic nor inelastic.
