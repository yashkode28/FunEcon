                                Price floors are the minimum prices set by the government on certain goods and services. With regulated goods and services, the government does not want free distribution across the market for everyone to access, so they set a minimum price for these goods and services so that firms can supply more of this but demand from consumers goes down. Price floors also ensure people are earning a minimum salary for what they are producing. A common example of this is minimum wage. Governments may set a price floor for minimum wage if they feel like workers are not earning enough for what they are producing. In equilibrium, people will buy these goods where supply and demand meet. In the graph to the right, this would be a quantity of 200 for a price of $20. However, with the new price floor set at $30, this creates a surplus, where supply is greater than demand. Price floors are always set above the equilibrium price in order to be effective. The quantity supplied by producers is 300 labeled by Qs, and the quantity demanded by consumers is 100, labeled by Qd. There is a surplus of 200, as Qd - Qs = 300 - 100 = 200. Because the price is now higher than people would usually like to pay for this product, less people are going to want to buy it.

                                Price ceilings are the maximum prices set by the government on certain goods and services. Governments impose price ceilings for products that consumers need but might be too expensive if prices are set at equilibrium. An example of this is rent control. Like any other free market without government interventions, consumers and producers will buy and sell products at equilibrium, where supply meets demand. For low income people, this a problem as they cannot afford the rent that everyone else is able to pay. This is where price ceilings come into play. Price ceilings are always set below the equilibrium price. By setting a price below the equilibrium, this ensures that more people can pay for certain goods/services like rent. To the right is an example of a price ceiling. The equilibrium is at a price of 3 with a quantity of 30. However, when the price ceiling is set at 2, the quantiy supplied by producers is 20 as denoted by Qs, and the quantity demanded by consumers is 40. There is a shortage of 20, as Qs - Qd = 40 - 20 = 20.
